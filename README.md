# SOLvitae template project

SOLvitae project concerns the digital identity field and aims to provide people with a reliable and decentralized way to demonstrate their professional profile. Users are assigned a dNFT representing their “Curriculum Vitae” and each job experience, training course or convention can be certified directly by the employer, course provider or organizer through our platform.

NEXT improvements:
- disable future minting: the Solana TOKEN-20222 Program doesn't let me disable future minting changing the AuthorityType.MintTokens to null as made in the Token Program (the token program without extensions such as the metadata extension).
